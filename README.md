# Known-Precursor

This mod adds an edict available that will open a selection screen where you can pick your precursor.
This edict will disappear when you select/discover a precursor.

Baol and Zroni will only be available for selection if you or the host owns Ancient Relics DLC.
Baol and Zroni dig-sites will spawn nearby your starting system.

To manually open the precursor selection menu write event `precursor_selection.0` in console.
